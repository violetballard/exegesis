## Thread Handoff Packet

- Branch name: `codex/feat-context-storage`
- Reviewed commit(s):
  - `47cda4df831ac41867a8792f40d720e0cb109514`

## Scope completed

The lane preserved `recovered_from` cleanup timestamps across basket, context-set, and vault canonical rewrite paths so recovery cleanup keeps the existing `updated_at` while stripping recovery provenance. The only non-owned file in the final handoff is the lane-approved shared regression test `tests/unit/test_context_storage_recovery.py`, and no `scripts/scope-check.sh` edit is part of the final handoff.

## Files changed

- `src/qual/context/set_store.py`
- `src/qual/context/store.py`
- `src/qual/storage/vault.py`
- `tests/unit/test_context_storage_recovery.py`

## Tasks completed

1. Reused the existing cleanup timestamp in `ContextBasketStore` recovery so canonical cleanup rewrites keep the prior `updated_at` value.
2. Reused the existing cleanup timestamp in `ContextSetStore` recovery so canonical cleanup rewrites keep the prior `updated_at` value.
3. Reused the existing cleanup timestamp in `VaultService` recovery so canonical cleanup rewrites keep the prior `updated_at` value.
4. Added regression coverage for preserved `updated_at` behavior in basket, context set, and vault recovery paths.
5. Re-ran the required lane gates and confirmed the branch passes them.

## Approved exception note

- Approved shared test-file exception for `tests/unit/test_context_storage_recovery.py`; provenance documented in `.codex/packets/lanes/feat-context-storage/inbox/feature/F__codex-feat-context-storage__7b756291349fb12b27d07cf355a9b1b863759aa2__20260328T173918Z.md`.

## Scope-check / ownership note

- Shared/integrator-locked edits: only the approved shared test exception
- Ownership detail: runtime edits are limited to `src/qual/context/**` and `src/qual/storage/**`. The only non-owned edit is `tests/unit/test_context_storage_recovery.py`, covered by the lane-approved shared-test exception referenced above. No integrator-locked files were edited.
