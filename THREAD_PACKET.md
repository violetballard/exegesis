## Thread Handoff Packet

- Branch name: `codex/feat-retrieval-fts`
- Reviewed commit(s):
  - `c4944661a0a682821c486810918c2c1fabac1a41`
  - `c92025af6e11c396f84356967cea704cadb20f5b`

## Scope completed

This handoff covers the FTS-first retrieval MVP work: source-bundle snapshots rehydrate canonical retrieval context deterministically, excerpt payloads and provenance stay stable and auditable, and excerpt lookups now record deterministic audit context. PageIndex and embeddings remain deferred as fallback-only plumbing, and the handoff stays limited to the retrieval-owned feature surface.

## Files changed

- `src/qual/engine/retrieval/payload.py`
- `tests/unit/test_unified_retrieval.py`
- `src/qual/retrieval/service.py`

## Tasks completed

1. Accepted source-bundle context fallbacks in the engine payload helpers and verified snapshot safety in regression tests.
2. Added the excerpt lookup audit trail in the retrieval service.
3. Threaded `lookup_entrypoint` through the two public FTS excerpt entrypoints so the audit trail can distinguish them.
4. Recorded `lookup_resolution` in the excerpt audit trail so direct FTS hits and fallback resolution remain distinguishable.
