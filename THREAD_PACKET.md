## Thread Handoff Packet

- Branch name: `codex/feat-context-storage`
- Reviewed commit(s):
  - `47cda4df831ac41867a8792f40d720e0cb109514`
- Final head SHA:
  - `f36909cca41b0717ef1b2eb0591254703c389d03`

## Scope completed

The feature commit preserved `recovered_from` cleanup timestamps across basket, context-set, and vault canonical rewrite paths so recovery cleanup keeps the existing `updated_at` while stripping recovery provenance. The handoff packet now stays self-contained and limits the reviewed file list to owned runtime paths plus the approved regression-test exception.

## Files changed

- `src/qual/context/set_store.py`
- `src/qual/context/store.py`
- `src/qual/storage/vault.py`
- `tests/unit/test_context_storage_recovery.py`

## Tasks completed

1. Reused the existing cleanup timestamp in `ContextBasketStore` recovery so canonical cleanup rewrites keep the prior `updated_at` value.
2. Reused the existing cleanup timestamp in `ContextSetStore` recovery so canonical cleanup rewrites keep the prior `updated_at` value.
3. Reused the existing cleanup timestamp in `VaultService` recovery so canonical cleanup rewrites keep the prior `updated_at` value.
4. Added regression coverage for preserved `updated_at` behavior in basket, context set, and vault recovery paths.
5. Reissued the handoff packet so the reviewed file list is limited to owned paths plus the approved test exception.
6. Updated the final head bookkeeping to the current branch tip.

## Scope-check / ownership note

- Shared/integrator-locked edits: `NO`
- Ownership detail: runtime edits are limited to `src/qual/context/**` and `src/qual/storage/**`. The only non-owned edit is `tests/unit/test_context_storage_recovery.py`, covered by the lane-approved regression-test exception referenced above. No integrator-locked files were edited.
